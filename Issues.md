## Issues ##
If you want to report a bug or request a new feature, the most direct method is to [create an issue](https://github.com/icsadvprj/ICS-Advisory-Project/issues) in this
repository. We recommend that you first search through existing issues (both open and closed) to check if your particular issue has already been reported. You might want to add a comment to the existing issue if it has. If it hasn't, then feel free to create a new one.
